In the age of the customer, technology transformation has outpaced our ability to stay relevant. It is practically impossible to keep track of a field full of flickering light bulbs where ideas flow, outgrow, shine and also succumb. In these ever-changing times, true success is in the ability to adapt, share ideas, take risks, willingness to give up and move-on. As nimble an enterprise strives to be, the hardest part is to cross-navigate several open-source technologies, peer solutions like public cloud and still maintain the level of control without compromising security. Doubling down on the complexity is the ever changing notion of edge. The use-case to begin with was to enable remote network manageability but with changing consumer preferences coupled with covid, there exists no boundary.



With time value of money shooting up, data needs to flow seamlessly everywhere and anywhere. The competitive landscape attests to the survival of the fittest and this requires actionable leadership, vision, customer-first, customer-last approach and here at Aruba, we are extremely conscious of the way we blend ideas, technology and customer preferences. This inspired Aruba’s cloud-transformation journey and the whole idea of unified solution was born which is highly disruptive even in the face of the pandemic.  This was possible due to the convergence of industry’s best practices, solutions, bright minds and customer centric mindset.



Just like it takes an entire army of ants to build an anthill, Aruba’s success has been a culmination of a long journey where its offerings are focused on simplified, universal end-to-end solutions which are designed keeping in mind the existing customers. Essentially, you don’t have to throw your earbuds when you don’t find a slot in your phone! A seamless upgrade is always possible in the most cost-efficient manner. At Aruba, we believe in staying updated than outdated!

 

Let us take a peek at some of the design practices followed at Aruba and why it generates a broader appeal in the industry-   

   

Agile Devops Methodology where a layered approach helps build features incrementally without compromising time-to-market and ability to adapt quickly to new changes. This has been the backbone of Aruba's Cloud journey.

## Kubernetes

**Kubernetes** - A popular open-source solution for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. Aruba’s flagship product Aruba Central, is a cloud service based on kubernetes designed for unified network manageability for campus,branch, remote and datacenter networks. Aruba’s ESP launch takes it a step further where it enables AIOps on top of this cloud data to predict and root cause problems even before they occur!

## Micro services architecture

**Micro services architecture** - Think of those days where a phone service was bound by a 2 year contract and how one had to live with it even if they were unhappy. This world is comparable to mono-lithic architecture and with the influx of micro-service architecture, applications gained freedom as they are hosted as a collection of services and easily scalable.

## Continuous integration/continuous delivery

**Continuous integration/continuous delivery** pipeline tools help monitoring the release workflow. 


## Security scanning

**Security scanning** - where essentially the code is submitted for review via GIT and subjected to test suites to gauge any security vulnerabilities, bugs which the developers can act upon before the code merges onto production environment.


## Automation framework

**Automation framework** - wherever possible improves efficiency.

 

    **On a side note, it makes me wonder- do we need to go this fast and where are we exactly heading? Is perfection a necessity?**

We as humans have limited cognitive ability and is the very reason why we need to focus on what really matters.  Smarter solutions relieve us of the menial tasks so one can tackle the most important problems!  

Although that makes me wonder if we will eventually run out of problems to solve and our only problem would be not being able to find a new problem!
